Stand-alone scripts for running one or more IPIMBs.

See the sample scripts for basic operation:
   - sampleNoise.csh is a calibration script for testing a board in the 
     absence of an external trigger
   - sampleSignalExtTrigger.csh reads signal using an external trigger and 
     fixed parameters
   - sampleSweepExtTrigger.csh reads signal using an external trigger while
     sweeping the delay timing, aka "scope mode" 

The user will likely want to tune a few of the parameters to suit the
situation, in particular --serial (the PCIe port addressed - see the
portmap file), --diodebias (the bias in volts, here set to 0 for safety), 
and --delay for the sampleSignalExtTrigger script.

Multiple boards at ports m, n, o, p, ... can be read out by specifying 
--serial m,n,o,p,...

For the sampleNoise script I find the system runs at 125 Hz:
Captured 1000 samples ... done.
total acquisition section time in s: 8.00127792358
